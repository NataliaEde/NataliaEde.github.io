It's been almost a year since I've been on a prolonged leave after giving birth to my third child. Prior to taking this leave, I had spent ten years in financial services as an Investor Relations Personnel. A large portion of my position was dealing with datasets which were primarily collected on excel spreadsheets.

While I enjoyed working for an asset management firm, I was looking for a change. I hoped to transition into a job focused more on technology where I would be able to materialize my drive to innovate and solve problems. I was always interested in technology but couldn't quite find the right path to make that transition. 

I began to contemplate my next career move and started to research jobs online. I was specifically looking for positions that would allow me to work remotely and had decent compensation, and that's when I quickly stumbled upon Data Science. I engaged in further research and the more I learned about it the more I felt it was the perfect fit for me. 

I've always loved to analyze data, measure it, and conclude patterns. I also particularly like to use my creativity with the visualization of data. 

While I've only been studying Data Science for a couple of months, I can already tell it's the right decision for me and I couldn't be happier.
